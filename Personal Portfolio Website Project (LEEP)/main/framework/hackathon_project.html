                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>This project was part of a 3-week hackathon hosted by the Blacks at Microsoft apprenticeship program. The challenge was to develop a technology-driven solution for the social good of society, with a strong emphasis on AI. Our team created **Vet4Net**, an app designed to connect current military personnel and veterans to various social services like doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, and other resources that would help them thrive.</p>
